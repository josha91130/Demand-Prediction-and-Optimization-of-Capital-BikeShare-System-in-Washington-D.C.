# Demand-Prediction-and-Optimization-of-Capital-BikeShare-System-in-Washington-D.C.
Bike-sharing systems have become an integral component of urban transportation, offering a sustainable and convenient alternative for both residents and visitors. In Washington, D.C., the Capital Bikeshare (CaBi) program has been pivotal in connecting neighborhoods and reducing reliance on cars.

According to Greater Greater Washington, the CaBi system has experienced a surge in popularity, with ridership reaching record-breaking levels. From October 2023 to October 2024, the number of rides increased by nearly 50 percent, reflecting a growing adoption of bike-sharing as a primary mode of urban transit. This growth is driven by both daily commuters and tourists exploring the city, making CaBi an essential part of Washington's mobility ecosystem.

While the growing demand for shared bikes highlights the success of bike-sharing systems, it also introduces operational challenges. The rapid rise in ridership has amplified the complexity of predicting demand and ensuring the availability of bikes across all stations at the right time. This issue is further compounded by diverse user behaviors influenced by time of day, weather, seasons, and station locations. Without effective demand forecasting and resource allocation, users may experience frustration due to bike shortages or docking issues.

This project aims to analyze daily bike rental demand in Washington, D.C., and investigate the impact of various factors, including weather patterns, seasonal trends, and station-specific imbalances. By identifying critical usage patterns and imbalances, this study seeks to provide actionable insights that will help Capital Bikeshare optimize resource distribution, enhance user experience, and maintain its role as a reliable transportation option.
